# Divider

Divider is a Python utility for dividing Python files into classes and functions and saving them into separate files.

## Overview

Divider consists of two main components:

- `divider.py`: Contains the `divide` class, which takes a Python file as input, identifies classes and functions within the file, and saves them as separate Python files.

- `file_template.py`: Contains the `file` class, which is used for initializing and processing Python files. It includes methods for checking file extensions, downloading file contents, finding external imports, and aggregating file content.

## Usage

To use Divider, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/divider.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the "divider" folder:

   ```
   cd divider
   ```

4. Run the `divider.py` script with the Python file you want to divide as input:

   ```
   python divider.py your_python_file.py
   ```

   Replace `your_python_file.py` with the path to your Python file.

5. Divider will create separate Python files for each class and function found in the input file.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use Divider:

```python
from divider import divide

# Initialize Divider with the path to the Python file
divider = divide("file_template.py")

# Save the divided classes and functions into separate files
divider.save()
```
